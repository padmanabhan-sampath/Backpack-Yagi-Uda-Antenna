# Backpack-Yagi-Uda-Antenna

**The initial pictures of the antenna are uploaded to the repo. Further details will be populated in the coming weeks.**

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a lightweight, collapsible VHF (2m) 3-element Yagi-Uda antenna for amateur satellite works.

Existing DIY antennas listed below provided a good starting point for the project. These designs, although light weight and portable, are not mechanically sturdy for satellite operations.

2. [Ultra-lightweight 2m Yagi for SOTA](http://www.schnizer.com/SOTAblog/equipment/lightweight-2m-yagi-sota/)
3. [Collapsible KD5IVP Backpacking Yagi Antenna](https://irongarment.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/collapsible-kd5ivp-backpacking-yagi-antenna/)
4. [Collapsible Fabric Yagi Antenna](https://makezine.com/2010/05/01/collapsible-fabric-yagi-antenna/)

The design proposed here makes use of the cheap and ubiquitous telescopic antennas as elements for the Yagi-Uda antenna.



## Antenna Design
The antenna was designed using the [4nec2](https://www.qsl.net/4nec2/) antenna simulation software.
